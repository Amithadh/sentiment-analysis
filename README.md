# sentiment-analysis
To write a **README** file for your **Sentiment Analysis** project, you want to provide clear and concise information about your project, its purpose, how to use it, and any other relevant details. Here's a sample template to get you started:

# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on a given dataset using [mention technology or framework, e.g., Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning]. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Training models to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
    cd sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Dataset
You can use datasets like [IMDb reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews), [Amazon reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews), or any custom dataset. Make sure your dataset is in the correct format (e.g., CSV with columns for text and labels).

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the dataset**: 
    Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for model training.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py --input data/dataset.csv --output data/cleaned_data.csv
    ```

2. **Train the model**:
    Train a model on the cleaned data.
    ```bash
    python train.py --input data/cleaned_data.csv --model sentiment_model.pkl
    ```

3. **Test the model**:
    Evaluate the trained model on test data.
    ```bash
    python test.py --model sentiment_model.pkl --test data/test.csv
    ```

4. **Predict sentiment**:
    Use the trained model to predict sentiment for new data.
    ```bash
    python predict.py --model sentiment_model.pkl --text "I love this product!"
    ```

## Results

Include a summary of your model's performance here. For example:

- Accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 82%
- Recall: 84%

You may also want to include sample visualizations, such as confusion matrices or accuracy graphs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, etc.
- NLP techniques for data preprocessing
- Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression)

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

### Additional Tips:
- Make sure to adjust the content based on your actual implementation (e.g., model type, preprocessing steps).
- Provide sufficient usage instructions for users to easily run your code.
- Keep the README clean and informative.
